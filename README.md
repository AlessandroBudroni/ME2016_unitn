In this project, we developed a hybrid approach for verifying multimedia use on Twitter.

The project contains below main parts:

1. Image_Forensics: extract forensic features from images in development set and test set.

2. Text_Retrieval: perform google image reverse search and extract relevant websites containing images similar to the query image. To videos, extract users' comments from Youtube.

3. Textual_Feature: extract useful textual features from text retrieved in part 2.

4. Tweet features: from a user's post, extract post-based and user-based features.
